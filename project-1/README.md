#### Project Description

In this project, we look at regression for the oscilliatory behavior of the Runge function at $[-1,1]$. OLS, Ridge, Lasso and Gradient Descent are applied, and the nuance of their behavior are explored through the lens of statistical learning, numerical approximation and linear algebra.

#### Installation

In order to install the project, simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viktorbgulbrandsen/fysstk3155
cd project-1
pip install -r requirements.txt #we suggest making a venv first
```


#### Notebooks: 
Currently, in code/notebooks/uke39 the notebook for week39.ipynb can be found. This will be updated with notebooks replicating and exploring the results of the project tasks.
